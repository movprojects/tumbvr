TumbVR is a very simple WebVR project made in a day using aFrameVR and NodeJS.

The point is to create a minimalist VR project where the user can see photos from Tumblr as if they were exposed in an artist galery.

You can watch the experience in VR using WebVR-compatible browsers and heaset (which is pretty much anyone of them. Pretty much):
